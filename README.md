## Introduction

Welcome to Open Textbook Solutions! This service hopes to solve the issue of the
current lack of well written solutions to textbook exercises. Being able to
reliably check your work, or to simply look up how a problem is solved can be 
invaluable to one's learning!

## Using the service

Found at [opentextbooksolutions.org](opentextbooksolutions.org), the website is
the main method of interacting with the service. When the site is completed you
will be able to find all of the textbook solutions here in an easily searchable
manner.

### Solution Releases

When the first official releases are created, you will be able to find compiled
PDFs for all textbook solutions in a compressed folder in the releases section.

### Compiling from source

If you want, you can clone the repository for yourself, and compile the latex
document for any solution set that you wish!
